# Chamois
I grew up in the small town of Chamois, Chamois has a population of only 377 people.  
Chamois has a small highschool that I went to that only has 60 kids in the entire  
school. While going to school I did almost every in school activity that I could such as:
 * FFA
 * FBLA
 * Basketball
 * Baseball
 * Track
 * Cross Country
